### What is Data Cleaning?

Data Cleaning is the process of ensuring data is correct, consistent, and usable. You can clean data by identifying errors or corruptions, correcting or deleting them, or manually processing data as needed to prevent the same errors from occurring.
### What are the benefits of Data Cleaning?
There are many benefits to having clean data:
1. It removed major errors and inconsistencies that are in-evitable when multiple sources of data are being pulled into one dataset.
2. Using tools to clean up data will make everyone on your team more efficient as you'll be able to quickly get what you need from the data available to you.
3. Fewer errors mean happier customers and fewer frustrated employees.
4. It allows you to map different data functions to better understand what your data is intended to do, and learn where it is coming from.
